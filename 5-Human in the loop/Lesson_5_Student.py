# # Lesson 5: Human in the Loop

# Note: This notebook is running in a later version of langgraph that it was filmed with. The later version has a couple of key additions:
# - Additional state information is stored to memory and displayed when using `get_state()` or `get_state_history()`.
# - State is additionally stored every state transition while previously it was stored at an interrupt or at the end.
# These change the command output slightly, but are a useful addtion to the information available.

# ### Run it!
# Now, set the thread and run!

# In[ ]:

# ### Look at current state

# Get the current state. Note the `values` which are the AgentState. Note the `config` and the `thread_ts`. You will be using those to refer to snapshots below.

# In[ ]:


graph.get_state(thread)


# View all the statesnapshots in memory. You can use the displayed `count` agentstate variable to help track what you see. Notice the most recent snapshots are returned by the iterator first. Also note that there is a handy `step` variable in the metadata that counts the number of steps in the graph execution. This is a bit detailed - but you can also notice that the *parent_config* is the *config* of the previous node. At initial startup, additional states are inserted into memory to create a parent. This is something to check when you branch or *time travel* below.

# ### Look at state history

# In[ ]:


for state in graph.get_state_history(thread):
    print(state, "\n")


# Store just the `config` into an list. Note the sequence of counts on the right. `get_state_history` returns the most recent snapshots first.

# In[ ]:


states = []
for state in graph.get_state_history(thread):
    states.append(state.config)
    print(state.config, state.values['count'])


# Grab an early state.

# In[ ]:


states[-3]


# This is the state after Node1 completed for the first time. Note `next` is `Node2`and `count` is 1.

# In[ ]:


graph.get_state(states[-3])


# ### Go Back in Time
# Use that state in `invoke` to go back in time. Notice it uses states[-3] as *current_state* and continues to node2,

# In[ ]:


graph.invoke(None, states[-3])


# Notice the new states are now in state history. Notice the counts on the far right.

# In[ ]:


thread = {"configurable": {"thread_id": str(1)}}
for state in graph.get_state_history(thread):
    print(state.config, state.values['count'])


# You can see the details below. Lots of text, but try to find the node that start the new branch. Notice the parent *config* is not the previous entry in the stack, but is the entry from state[-3].

# In[ ]:


thread = {"configurable": {"thread_id": str(1)}}
for state in graph.get_state_history(thread):
    print(state,"\n")


# ### Modify State
# Let's start by starting a fresh thread and running to clean out history.

# In[ ]:


thread2 = {"configurable": {"thread_id": str(2)}}
graph.invoke({"count":0, "scratch":"hi"},thread2)


# In[ ]:


from IPython.display import Image

Image(graph.get_graph().draw_png())


# In[ ]:


states2 = []
for state in graph.get_state_history(thread2):
    states2.append(state.config)
    print(state.config, state.values['count'])   


# Start by grabbing a state.

# In[ ]:


save_state = graph.get_state(states2[-3])
save_state


# Now modify the values. One subtle item to note: Recall when agent state was defined, `count` used `operator.add` to indicate that values are *added* to the current value. Here, `-3` will be added to the current count value rather than replace it.

# In[ ]:


save_state.values["count"] = -3
save_state.values["scratch"] = "hello"
save_state


# Now update the state. This creates a new entry at the *top*, or *latest* entry in memory. This will become the current state.

# In[ ]:


graph.update_state(thread2,save_state.values)


# Current state is at the top. You can match the `thread_ts`.
# Notice the `parent_config`, `thread_ts` of the new node - it is the previous node.

# In[ ]:


for i, state in enumerate(graph.get_state_history(thread2)):
    if i >= 3:  #print latest 3
        break
    print(state, '\n')


# ### Try again with `as_node`
# When writing using `update_state()`, you want to define to the graph logic which node should be assumed as the writer. What this does is allow th graph logic to find the node on the graph. After writing the values, the `next()` value is computed by travesing the graph using the new state. In this case, the state we have was written by `Node1`. The graph can then compute the next state as being `Node2`. Note that in some graphs, this may involve going through conditional edges!  Let's try this out.

# In[ ]:


graph.update_state(thread2,save_state.values, as_node="Node1")


# In[ ]:


for i, state in enumerate(graph.get_state_history(thread2)):
    if i >= 3:  #print latest 3
        break
    print(state, '\n')


# `invoke` will run from the current state if not given a particular `thread_ts`. This is now the entry that was just added.

# In[ ]:


graph.invoke(None,thread2)


# Print out the state history, notice the `scratch` value change on the latest entries.

# In[ ]:


for state in graph.get_state_history(thread2):
    print(state,"\n")


# Continue to experiment!
